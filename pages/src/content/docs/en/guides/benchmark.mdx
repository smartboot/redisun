# Redisun vs Redisson vs Jedis vs Lettuce Performance Test Report

Test time: Wed Oct 29 10:09:36 UTC 2025

## Test Environment

- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
- Java Version: JDK 8
- Redis Version: latest
- Test Key Count: 50000

<Aside title="AI Summary">

ðŸš€ **Core Conclusion**

According to test data, Redisun performs excellently in most test scenarios, especially with obvious advantages in high-concurrency and asynchronous operations. Different clients have their own characteristics in different scenarios, and the appropriate client should be selected according to specific usage scenarios.

ðŸ”§ **Architectural Advantages**
- Developed based on [smart-socket](https://github.com/smartboot/smart-socket) AIO framework
- Innovative connection multiplexing technology, single connection handles multiple concurrent requests
- Significantly reduces connection overhead, performs excellently under high concurrency

âš¡ **Objective Performance Analysis**

ðŸ“Œ **Synchronous SET operations detailed analysis**:
  - Low concurrency (1-16): Jedis performs best (8322 OPS), Redisun closely follows (6041-51124 OPS)
  - High concurrency (64+): Redisun performs best, reaching 92081 OPS peak at 128 concurrency
  - Redisun shows significant performance improvement from 1-16 concurrency (6041â†’51124 OPS), and maintains steady growth under high concurrency

ðŸ“Œ **Synchronous GET operations detailed analysis**:
  - Low concurrency (1-16): Jedis performs best (8301 OPS), Lettuce and Redisun perform comparably (5985-48780 OPS)
  - High concurrency (64+): Redisun performs best, reaching 88028 OPS peak at 128 concurrency
  - Redisun shows obvious performance advantages under high concurrency, and can still maintain 67204 OPS high performance at 2048 concurrency

ðŸ“Œ **Asynchronous SET operations detailed analysis**:
  - Redisun leads comprehensively, reaching 505050 OPS peak at 16 concurrency
  - About 5.4-14.3 times and 5.4-6.1 times that of Redisson (35385-38850 OPS) and Lettuce (82508-94161 OPS) respectively
  - Redisun maintains extremely high performance levels at all concurrency levels

ðŸ“Œ **Asynchronous GET operations detailed analysis**:
  - Redisun shows overwhelming leadership, reaching 543478 OPS peak at 16 concurrency
  - About 30.9-75.9 times and 55.0-102.7 times that of Redisson (7161-17458 OPS) and Lettuce (5293-9873 OPS) respectively
  - Redisun demonstrates the strongest performance advantage in asynchronous GET operations

ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Evaluation**
- Redisun has obvious advantages in high-concurrency scenarios, especially in asynchronous operations, but performs generally in low-concurrency scenarios
- Jedis performs excellently in low-concurrency scenarios (up to 8301 OPS), but performance drops significantly in high-concurrency scenarios (drops to 30450 OPS at 2048 concurrency)
- Lettuce performs stably and relatively balanced, performing well in medium concurrency
- Redisson performs adequately in synchronous operations, but is not recommended for high-concurrency asynchronous scenarios

ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Usage Scenarios**
- **Redisun**: High-concurrency, asynchronous operations, scenarios with extremely high performance requirements
- **Jedis**: Low-concurrency, simple application scenarios
- **Lettuce**: Medium concurrency, scenarios requiring stability
- **Redisson**: Scenarios mainly based on synchronous operations, not recommended for high-concurrency asynchronous scenarios
